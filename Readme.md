### Launch Application
The program is built using CMake technology. CMake gathers all the user-defined header files and included libraries, and
compiles them. With this, the new executable file is created, so that all it requires to launch the program is to run that executable file. To access that executable file a user needs to go to the build repository:
> cd build
> 
and simply type the name of that file to the terminal:
> ./gameOfLife
> 
Voila! You can observe the evolution of alive and dead cells.
